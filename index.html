# schema.org
## dan brickley + TV
## Sep 7, 2017

_run this locally:_
```bash
git clone https://github.com/traceypooh/schema.org; open schema.org/index.html
```

---
- adopted by google / bing
- extend to media clips
- runs headless browser to get data (eg: JSON-LD)

---
# javascript
- suggests _not_ using / minimizing JS to avoid headless browser requirements
- that should be OK for _archive_ pages (we dont SPA and have minimal JS DOM changes)
- dan says can have isssue, if do search on bing..
  - then surfacing 'there is a factcheck avail for this clip' can have JS issues

# claim review (eg: ptr to TV clip on 3rd party site)
- http://schema.org/ClaimReview
- https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/1686
- has video clip pointer
- use W3C media fragments or not?
- right now it's fairly article based for google/schema.org
- prolly _should_ make schema.org have affordance for video vs. audio cited clip
  - _may already!_ (see next slide)
